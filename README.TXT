Samsung Moment Edition v1.3 by SDX Developers

Wifi Tether for Root Users
--------------------------

This software turns your android-based handset into "something" like a wireless-access point 
(that's incorrect in technical-view because the wireless-interface will be set-up in AdHoc-Mode). 
Clients can connect via wifi and get access to internet using the 3G-connection which is 
established by the handset.

Warning:
--------
This application needs root-permission, and a custom kernel which supports wifi tethering on the Samsung Moment.
